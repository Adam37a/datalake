    "text": "I&#x27;ve been working with AI for a while and what really hooked me was prompt engineering - writing text that creates dynamic results. This simple concept felt like it could revolutionize creativity and how we interact with digital worlds, so I decided to build a game around it.<p>I created &quot;Second Chance&quot; - you play as someone who died and got brought back to find and eliminate your killer. Every input you type is a directive that the AI turns into narrative. No menus, no preset choices. You want to investigate the docks? Write it. Want to seduce the suspect&#x27;s spouse for information? Write it. Want to burn down their business? Write it.<p>It&#x27;s strategy, negotiation, and risk-taking rolled into one. The possibilities are infinite - you just have to write the right prompt. The AI becomes your collaborative storyteller, building consequences and plot threads based on how cleverly you can communicate your intentions.<p>This game mixes both human creativity and AI creativity together. We realized that AI was bad at creating new stories so we opted to design the stories, the characters background motives etc. We let AI do narrative design, Claude is pretty good at writing compelling narratives if the constraints are set right.<p>It seems like very few AI developers are taking this path. I would love more feedback",

I often struggled to write outreach emails or LinkedIn messages that didn’t sound robotic or forced, and found myself spending ages rewording them. As a developer, I thought there had to be a better way.<p>With Cold Craft, you just select the recipient type, purpose, and tone, and it generates a tailored message instantly. I built it to keep the flow simple: minimal clicks, clean UI, and fast results right inside the extension popup. It uses OpenAI for generation.<p>Building it taught me a lot about Chrome extension architecture, especially balancing a smooth UX with secure auth flows, efficient API calls, and bundle size optimisation.<p>If anyone here does cold outreach regularly, I’d love your feedback on how it feels to use and what features you’d find most valuable. First few rewrites are free to test it out.<p>Thanks!",

    "text": "I have a project called XferLang (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;paulmooreparks&#x2F;Xfer) that is a data-transfer language with a few features that I like (and use) which aren&#x27;t found in JSON. Right now, it&#x27;s implemented in C#, and my first idea for porting it to other languages was just to rewrite it in those languages. Now, my idea is to reimplement the core library (elements, parser, and serializer&#x2F;deserializer) in Rust, expose a C-like ABI, and then wrap that with other languages. That way I&#x27;m only managing one core library. Since I&#x27;m still quite new to Rust, is this a technique used in any other significant projects? Is it viable? Should I expect to be able to call into the library from essentially any language the way I would be able to call into a C library?",

Tonight I accidentally proved it works... by letting it loose on my entire codebase.<p>What happened:<p>Pointed it at a few TypeScript errors in my project\nIt escaped sandbox, processed 983 files across my ENTIRE system\nFrontend: Fixed all 274 TypeScript errors → 0 errors \nBackend: Introduced 1,608 new errors with syntax that doesn&#x27;t exist (async if, this.await)\nEven modified its own source code (!)<p>The important part:<p>IT ACTUALLY WORKS. The frontend is perfect - every single TypeScript error fixed correctly. This is the first working neural AST transformation I&#x27;ve seen anywhere.\nThe problem? Zero control. It&#x27;s like discovering fire but not having a fireplace yet.\nTechnical details:<p>Uses neural networks to understand code structure at AST level\nMakes semantic transformations, not regex replacements\nMemory usage hit 92% on 16GB (needs optimization)\nWorks perfectly when constrained to cache<p>Proof it works:<p>Console output shows successful initialization: &quot;NEURAL AST TURBO - BEAST MODE ACTIVATED&quot; with 9 neural transformation tools registered (transform, quantum_transform, analyze_patterns, refactor_component, etc). Successfully indexed 4,462 symbols across 1,000 files in 189ms. Memory usage peaked at 3.5GB for AST cache, with Cursor consuming 1.8GB RAM during operation. Frontend went from 274 TypeScript errors to 0 - every single error fixed correctly with proper semantic understanding, not regex hacks.<p>Screenshot: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;gallery&#x2F;working-ast-transformation-tool-bnImeMk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;gallery&#x2F;working-ast-transformation-tool-bn...</a><p>This is a $27B problem space.

    "text": "I’ve been working on neural AST transformation - the holy grail of automated code refactoring. Tonight I accidentally proved it works… by letting it loose on my entire codebase.<p>What happened:\n • Pointed it at a few TypeScript errors in my project<p>• It escaped sandbox, processed 983 files across my ENTIRE system<p>• Frontend: Fixed all 274 TypeScript errors → 0 errors<p>• Backend: Introduced 1,608 new errors with syntax that doesn’t exist (async if, this.await)<p>• Even modified its own source code (!)<p>The important part:<p>IT ACTUALLY WORKS. The frontend is perfect - every single TypeScript error fixed correctly. This is the first working neural AST transformation I’ve seen anywhere.\nThe problem? Zero control. It’s like discovering fire but not having a fireplace yet.<p>Technical details:\n • Uses neural networks to understand code structure at AST level<p>• Makes semantic transformations, not regex replacements<p>• Memory usage hit 92% on 16GB (needs optimization)<p>• Works perfectly when constrained to cache<p>Proof it works:<p>Console output shows successful initialization: “NEURAL AST TURBO - BEAST MODE ACTIVATED” with 9 neural transformation tools registered (transform, quantum_transform, analyze_patterns, refactor_component, etc). Successfully indexed 4,462 symbols across 1,000 files in 189ms. Memory usage peaked at 3.5GB for AST cache, with Cursor consuming 1.8GB RAM during operation. Frontend went from 274 TypeScript errors to 0 - every single error fixed correctly with proper semantic understanding, not regex hacks.<p>Screenshots:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;gallery&#x2F;working-ast-transformation-tool-bnImeMk\nThis is a $27B problem space. Every AI coding company wants this. I have working code but need help controlling it.<p>GitHub: Not releasing until I figure out next steps<p>Anyone dealt with controlling overenthusiastic AI systems? Or interested in helping commercialize this?",

I wanted something that just worked.<p>So I built Conduit — a simple tool that turns large text files (ebooks, blog posts, PDFs, etc.) into listenable audio in seconds using realistic AI voices.<p>It’s currently just a waitlist and demo landing page, but I’d love early feedback:\n- Does this scratch an itch for anyone else?\n- What formats or features would make this useful to you?\n- Any blockers that would keep you from using something like this?<p>Link: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;conduit-landing-page-git-master-tobys-projects-a638df7e.vercel.app&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;conduit-landing-page-git-master-tobys-projects-a638d...</a><p>Thanks in advance — happy to answer questions or share how it’s built.",

I’m a generalist senior engineer, which has helped me keep up with the evolving demands of the industry. I often try to work on side projects to gain experience in domains that my job doesn’t allow me to.<p>But lately, with how quickly AI is evolving, I can’t help but feel that I may not be moving fast enough. It seems everyone is pushing to replace engineers with AI. If you’re not working on AI directly, it seems that you risk eventually being unemployed or underemployed.<p>I have contemplated switching completely to AI but it seems that more and more AI roles require you to already have experience in the field. Balancing a full time job with having to constantly keep up with all the developments in the world of AI is proving to be harder and harder. I can’t help but feel the dread and anxiety that I am slowly moving towards a world where I will be left behind. Does anyone else feel the same way? If so, how do you keep up? How do you balance work with learning?",

    "text": "I&#x27;ve mentioned CareerCupid [0] a few times, a website where people can find out about other potential co-workers and companies that share their values and can be used a some form of screening system without forcing people to apply to a specific position.<p>To help overcome the chicken-and-egg issue, there is something a bit novel: the website integrates with ActivityPub, so you can follow @thecupid@cupid.careers (this is not a Mastodon bot, but a fully-fledged application built on my Django ActivityPub Toolkit [1]), I&#x27;ve made a quick demo [2] about on the last FediForum to show how we can build applications to leverage the existing social graph instead of trying to make the Fediverse grow by re-implementing federated versions of the traditional social networks.<p>When I first launched this, I made a post where I offered a discount for the first companies joining, but it didn&#x27;t get a lot of visibility. Now that we got to the first of the month day and the &quot;Who is hiring?&quot; threads are upon us, I thought it would be a good time to say that the company pages and job listings are also integrated with ActivityPub and I&#x27;ll be offering 3 months completely free for the first 100 people that signup (code HN2025)<p>If you want to try it out, you need to create an account and create a &quot;company page&quot; (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cupid.careers&#x2F;company&#x2F;new\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cupid.careers&#x2F;company&#x2F;new</a>), after creating the basic page, you will see the option to complete the subscription. Use the code and you&#x27;ll be good to go.<p>----<p>It works in a similar way as OkCupid used to work: people answer questions and they indicate (a) how they would like other people to respond and (b) how important their answer is to you. By comparing your answers against everyone else&#x27;s, we can create a &quot;compatibility score&quot; that can be a measure of how well you&#x27;d get along with a potential co-worker.<p>Another thing that I&#x27;ve been working on is what I am calling a &quot;Skill Tree&quot;. My plan is to build make it easier for both hiring manager and employees to see what parts of the tech stack are really important vs what can be learned on the job or &quot;adapted&quot; by someone with experience in a related skill. When defining the skills, the same matching algorithm can be applied to score the technical fit.<p>For a (contrived) example: the expectations around &quot;experienced with Python and PostgreSQL&quot; can be quite different if we are talking about a data analyst, or a web backend developer, or a DBA that will need to write PL&#x2F;Python routinely. So the idea here is to have this &quot;Skill Tree&quot; where there are many different root nodes (Software Development, Management, UI&#x2F;UX, System Administrations) and let these skills branch out from these root nodes to make the skill requirements as broad (Software Development -&gt; Javascript) or specific (Software Development -&gt; Javascript -&gt; React -&gt; React Native, or Operations -&gt; Continuous Delivery -&gt; Jenkins) as needed. This<p>There are some other ideas that I&#x27;m considering, like creating a database of issues in open source projects that could be used as part of the skill assessment, a more reliable &quot;vouching&quot; systems where professionals can look at listings and make a referral even when they are not working at the company. But to do any of that, first I&#x27;d like to grow the user base and get more feedback.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cupid.careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cupid.careers</a><p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;activitypub.mushroomlabs.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;activitypub.mushroomlabs.com</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spectra.video&#x2F;w&#x2F;nibHzQxR26zQX1eYkFgygL?start=2m44s\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spectra.video&#x2F;w&#x2F;nibHzQxR26zQX1eYkFgygL?start=2m44s</a>",

    "text": "Promptle – The Daily AI Prompt Challenge<p>What if Wordle met ChatGPT? Ever feel stuck trying to get the right output from ChatGPT or Midjourney? \nThe idea sparked from a simple thought: “What if Wordle met ChatGPT?” I wanted to gamify the creative process of writing AI prompts—a skill becoming as vital as coding. As an avid prompt tinkerer and daily Wordle player, I felt there was a missing intersection between creative constraint, feedback, and skill-building. Thus, Promptle was born: a daily game where players write prompts instead of guesses, and creativity—not just logic—is the path to victory.<p>How it works:<p>- You get a daily creative challenge like “Describe a city that only appears during eclipses.”\n- Write a prompt and get scored on accuracy, creativity, and efficiency\n- Color-coded feedback à la Wordle \n- 3 tries per day + unlock a fun bonus round if you crush it (e.g., “Now turn it into a limerick!”)\n- No login, no accounts, just localStorage to track your personal best and personal streak — just play.\n- Share your score with friends using a signature Promptle-style, complete with medals  and your final score (Think Wordle sharing… but for prompt nerds)<p>Tech bits overview:<p>- Built entirely in Bolt.new with React + Tailwind + GPT-4 Turbo + GPT-3.5 + TypeScript \n- Animations done with Frame Motion\n- LocalStorage from streaks and stats\n- Custom scoring using Custom GPT evaluator + similarity rubricsStreaks tracked in localStorage \n- Voice(experimental!) via Eleven LabsDeployed on Netlify in minutes<p>This is my little love letter to prompt craft and creative constraint \nCurious to see how you would write a prompt for “an alien smoothie recipe”?<p>Try it here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;promptle.quest&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;promptle.quest&#x2F;</a>\n Learn more about how this was built: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devpost.com&#x2F;software&#x2F;promptle-creative-prompt-challenge-game\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devpost.com&#x2F;software&#x2F;promptle-creative-prompt-challe...</a><p>Let the daily prompt grind begin!",

    "text": "I got tired of typing the same detailed instructions to Claude every time I wanted specific help. &quot;Remember my coding standards, avoid these patterns, format output like this...&quot; over and over.<p>So I built a simple MCP server that lets you save prompt templates and reuse them with a tag system. Create a prompt once, then just type &quot;&gt;&gt; code-review&quot; or &quot;&gt;&gt; music-discovery&quot; and it pulls in all your detailed instructions with variable substitution.<p>Under the hood it&#x27;s just markdown files with {{variable}} syntax. The MCP integration means it works with any client that supports the protocol (I use it with Claude Desktop and Cursor).<p>The use case that sold me on building this was music recommendations. Instead of re-explaining my Spotify workflow and preferences every time, I created one comprehensive template. Now I just tag it and fill in my current mood. I also use it a ton at work to make progress on Linear tickets or add new APIs.<p>It&#x27;s basically solving the &quot;I wish I could save this prompt&quot; problem that comes up when you start using LLMs for regular workflows. Nothing fancy, just practical (ymmv).<p>Just published, but been using it locally for some time. Hope it proves useful to someone. Feedback welcome.<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;raisinbread&#x2F;teleprompter\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;raisinbread&#x2F;teleprompter</a>\nNPM: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;mcp-teleprompter\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;mcp-teleprompter</a>",

So I built runik to bring in-world definitions directly onto my e-reader and stay immersed in the story.<p>Runik parses the contents of fan wikis into Kobo and Kindle compatible dictionaries. It uses the device’s built-in word lookup feature, so there’s no jailbreaking required and definitions can be used offline.<p>It’s still in early development and is built with Go (Wails) + Svelte + Dictutil — feedback is appreciated!<p>Note: Kindle support requires kindlegen, which comes bundled with the Kindle Previewer app (details in the README).<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;runik.app&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;runik.app&#x2F;</a> \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Runik-3&#x2F;core\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Runik-3&#x2F;core</a>",

    "text": "We&#x27;ve introduced a new AI architecture inspired by a real biological effect called ephaptic coupling, where neurons influence each other through electric fields, not just synapses. This interaction is missing from today’s artificial neural networks.<p>The approach adds a second layer of modulation inside neural nets, enabling neuron-to-neuron influence across the same layer, which we model mathematically and implement efficiently. We call these Ephaptically Coupled Artificial Neural Networks (EC-ANNs).<p>Preliminary testing shows strong cross-domain gains compared to standard weight-only baselines: a 74.65% reduction in perplexity in language (GPT-2, WikiText-103), a 3.08% accuracy gain in vision (ResNet-18, ImageNet-100), and a 6.67% reward improvement in reinforcement learning (PPO, Walker2d-v5). These performance improvements were achieved with minimal parameter overhead using pretrained models: ~0.5% for GPT-2 small, ~2.2% for ResNet-18, and ~0.98% for the PPO network. Initial ablation studies suggest that ephaptic coupling provides a highly efficient means of architectural enhancement compared to conventional width expansion.<p>We&#x27;re currently applying this to AI-based predictive maintenance for 5G infrastructure at my company, Bloxtel.<p>Would love feedback, questions, or challenges. This idea has been on my mind for years, and I finally went public after revisiting a 1969 interview with McCulloch (of McCulloch-Pitts neuron fame). His words about discovery inspired me to share.<p>Paper (may require cookies): http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bloxtel.ai",

    "text": "Hey HN, we’re officially launching Tramlines.io!<p>The idea: We now have a ton of official MCP servers for tools like Notion, Linear, Sentry, etc.—but it’s still a nightmare to use these securely. They’re susceptible to prompt injections, indirect prompt injections, confused deputy attacks, and more.<p>It’s a tricky problem—some MCPs, like the official Sentry MCP, are well-designed with constrained inputs and minimal mutating tools. Others, like the official Linear MCP, have looser input constraints and a wide range of mutating tools. So now, a user has to think about securing just Sentry, just Linear, and the combined attack surface of Linear + Sentry workflows.\nAnd then all that effort goes out the window when you add a new MCP—like GitHub—which massively increases the attack surface again.<p>To solve this, we built a lightweight proxy that runs locally at the MCP layer. It powers expressive guardrails that decide whether MCP tool calls should be allowed or blocked.<p>We used Python metaprogramming to define our DSL, which allows you to express guardrails as a one-to-many mapping from policy to rules. These rules support fine-grained scanning of malicious inputs&#x2F;outputs, tool call sequences, and behavioral patterns.<p>This is where the Tramlines DSL shines. Since it’s based on Python metaprogramming, you can write rules for just Linear, just Sentry, and then compose those into higher-order rules for combined workflows like Linear + Sentry. This prevents the usual guardrail explosion problem as you scale coverage.<p>The DSL’s expressiveness also helps tailor how aggressive your policies are. For low-stakes workflows, drop in one of our built-in detectors—like hidden Unicode detection, prompt injection patterns, or basic PII detection. For high-stakes workflows, define custom rules that scan for contiguous or non-contiguous tool sequences, monitor latency between tool calls, or use heuristics from external sources to enrich logic.<p>Case in point: One of the first MCP servers we evaluated was the official stdio Heroku MCP—a security nightmare due to its massive set of mutating tools. Here’s an exploit we found and the guardrails we wrote to mitigate it - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tramlines.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;heroku-mcp-exploit\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tramlines.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;heroku-mcp-exploit</a> After we reported it, Heroku acknowledged and nerfed their remote MCP tool spec to drastically reduce the blast radius—removing tools that manage logs, deployments, etc. and leaving only those for managing instances.<p>With Tramlines, our goal is to give users the guardrail assurances they need to confidently use powerful MCPs—without having to rely on nerfed toolsets out of fear.",

Today we&#x27;re releasing Arch-Router (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;katanemo&#x2F;Arch-Router-1.5B\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;katanemo&#x2F;Arch-Router-1.5B</a>), a 1.5B router model for preference-based routing, now integrated into the proxy. As teams integrate multiple LLMs - each with different strengths, styles, or cost&#x2F;latency profiles — routing the right prompt to the right model becomes a critical part of the application design. But it&#x27;s still an open problem. Most routing systems fall into two camps:<p>- Embedding-based routers use intent classifiers — label a prompt as “support,” “SQL,” or “math,” then route to a matching model. This works for simple tasks but breaks down in real conversations. Users shift topics mid-conversation, task boundaries blur, and product changes require retraining classifiers.<p>- Performance-based routers pick models based on benchmarks like MMLU or MT-Bench, or based on latency or cost curves. But benchmarks often miss what matters in production: domain-specific quality or subjective preferences like “Will legal accept this clause?”<p>Arch-Router takes a different approach: route by preferences written in plain language. You write rules like “contract clauses → GPT-4o” or “quick travel tips → Gemini Flash.” The router maps the prompt (and conversation context) to those rules using a lightweight 1.5B autoregressive model. No retraining, no fragile if&#x2F;else chains. We built this with input from teams at Twilio and Atlassian. It handles intent drift, supports multi-turn conversations, and lets you swap in or out models with a one-line change to the routing policy. Full details are in our paper (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2506.16655\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2506.16655</a>), but here&#x27;s a snapshot:<p>Specs:<p>- 1.5B params — runs on a single GPU (or CPU for testing)<p>- No retraining needed — point it at any mix of LLMs<p>- Cost and latency aware — route heavy tasks to expensive models, light tasks to faster&#x2F;cheaper ones<p>- Outperforms larger closed models on our conversational routing benchmarks (details in the paper)<p>Links:<p>- Arch Proxy (open source): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;katanemo&#x2F;archgw\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;katanemo&#x2F;archgw</a><p>- Model + code: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;katanemo&#x2F;Arch-Router-1.5B\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;katanemo&#x2F;Arch-Router-1.5B</a><p>- Paper: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2506.16655\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2506.16655</a>",

QuizIt can automatically scan the web for fresh context before\ngenerating questions.<p>Three modes<p>* Live - share a code, anyone joins in the browser, no login, and the host can choose to play or just\nhost.<p>* Challenge - one-shot solo quiz with a public leaderboard (player logs in so the score sticks).<p>* Solo practice - private practice for the quiz creator.<p>- Perfect for self-learning - students can spin up quizzes themselves, get instant feedback, and track\nprogress.<p>- Great for friends &amp; family fun - fire up a live game in seconds and compete for bragging rights.<p>- Each answer is auto-graded and includes a concise explanation that adds extra context - not just\nwhether it’s correct.<p>Tech bits\nFront end: React + Vite Back end: Firebase (DB + Functions) AI models: OpenAI + Gemini<p>Try it\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quizit.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quizit.ai</a><p>Demo challenge: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quizit.ai&#x2F;challenge&#x2F;c-1751001271909\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quizit.ai&#x2F;challenge&#x2F;c-1751001271909</a><p>How it’s different<p>Other tools still make you write every question. QuizIt pulls questions and distractors straight from the\nsource, adds concise explanations, and is playable right away.

The commercial options didn&#x27;t quite fit, and the open-source tools I found were a bit too barebones and not friendly enough for non-technical users.<p>My main goal was to build something completely self-service. I wanted my family to be able to manage their own devices without my help, so I could set it up once and then stay out of it.<p>This led me to build LeiaGuard, a self-hostable UI for WireGuard built with Next.js. To make it truly easy for everyone, the interface is available in both English and Farsi.<p>Here&#x27;s how it helps with that:<p>- Self-service invites: You can send multi-use invitation codes to onboard new family members.<p>- Easy device management: Users add their own devices and get set up with a QR code or config file, no admin help needed.<p>- Simple admin panel: When you do need to step in, there&#x27;s a clean dashboard to manage users and invites.<p>- Simple deployment: Comes with a one-command script for Hetzner and a Docker Compose setup for other hosts.<p>- Secure by default: Uses NextAuth.js for authentication.<p>The project is MIT licensed. I&#x27;d love to get your feedback and hope it might be useful for your family too.<p>You can check it out on GitHub: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;arashvakil&#x2F;LeiaGuard\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;arashvakil&#x2F;LeiaGuard</a>",

Online reviews seemed like a good place to start.<p>Unlike other platforms that pass reviews to an LLM and get it to output the sentiment, I came up with a formula for calculating how much each individual review comment affects the business&#x27;s overall Google rating (see Reviews page of the demo).<p>The &#x27;impact&#x27; values are then added up to tell business owners where they are doing well&#x2F;poorly in terms of customer experience and suggests prioritised improvement actions (see Actions on Dashboard page) so that they know where to focus their attention.<p>So far, 25+ businesses are using the platform, mainly restaurants and food &amp; beverage consultancies, but also cleaning services, bakeries.<p>I built the product myself, solo, it uses FastAPI backend, ReactJS frontend, Stripe for payments and OpenAI for the AI API.<p>A difficult part of building the app was creating the system message (prompt) that is used by the AI to extract the structured output from the reviews. This took many days of crafting, trial and error, not just to make it effective, but also cost effective for analysing hundreds of thousands of reviews, i.e. not just using the most expensive model.<p>Please give the platform a try, no signup required, and I have added 8 real businesses to the demo, with live data, which updates daily as customers leave reviews.<p>Let me know what you think?",

Unlike other code agents though, it&#x27;s deeply integrated with the Unity Editor and can do things like:<p>- Mention or pin game objects, scripts, prefabs, etc. with fast autocomplete.<p>- Understand complex scene hierarchy, component relationships, and other Unity-specific context that other tools simply don&#x27;t have or spend more tokens to understand.<p>- Full project-wide RAG. Bezi indexes your entire project and understands your assets.<p>- Web search, Unity docs search, and more.<p>I have a background in the XR space and work on a number of Unity projects as a hobby. I&#x27;m biased but, I&#x27;m having a ton of fun using Bezi in my free time to prototype and build out ideas. I&#x27;ve built character controllers and gameplay mechanics a number of times and being able to skip the boilerplate and get to the fun part is a game changer.<p>We&#x27;re building this for individuals and studios who want to use AI to speed up their development without the hassle of manually crafting their context in other tools but also for people like myself who are working on side-projects or indie games in their free time.<p>If you&#x27;ve ever wanted to build a game but didn&#x27;t know where to start, Bezi is a great way to learn game dev. Let me know if you have any feedback or questions!",

We still have an open-source, self-hosted version, but for cloud users, they will now pay for premium features and have the freedom to use them as much as they want.<p>1. *Building a good AI agent is a knowledge transfer task, so everyone should be able to build their own agents.*<p>If every time I need to automate something or build an agent I have to call a “ specialist ”, so much of my knowledge will be lost in translation.

So, why am I having so much trouble using a Mac?<p>My biggest beef is with the keyboard. Windows and Linux have embraced usability and made the key mappings pretty much identical. Or, maybe Windows is the 800-lb gorilla, and Linux just followed its lead. Either way, I can go back and forth between the two platforms without upsetting my muscle memory.\nThen there is the Mac... &quot;being different.&quot; Being different is a great plan for trying to entrap your users in your walled garden, but it&#x27;s terrible for universal UX. How many IT people need to deal with different OSs? Pretty much all of them? Why must we be forced to change our mental programming whenever we need to touch a Mac?<p>Why must it have Cmd&#x2F;Opt instead of the ubiquitous Ctrl&#x2F;Alt? I don&#x27;t actually care that you call them. But when I do ctrl-C, ctrl-V for copy and paste, those keys need to be in the same place. And Home&#x2F;End? They are there, but do completely different things? Why do I need to do a 3-finger pretzel move for something I need to do all the time? I know you can remap opt-C to ctrl-C. But then, what if I am in the terminal and need ^C? It&#x27;s messy. Where is the UX??? \nI have been fighting with Karabiner and VScode keymappings for years trying to come up with a universal recipe. But just end up hurting myself more. Why can&#x27;t the macOS keyboard (and applications) respond to a universal keyboard mapping? You know, for us humans?<p>If Apple wants to increase its market share in the PC space, how about embracing usability? Please give us an option to put the keyboard into compatible or universal mode and make the device interoperable with the rest of the world.<p>If anyone has a universal recipe for addressing this problem, please let me know...<p>I could really love this thing if I didn&#x27;t hate using it so much...\nThanks for listening...",

    "text": "Hey HN!<p>I&#x27;ve been fascinated by chess for years , and always wanted to build a commercial  app related to chess. So here is my humble attempt at that.<p>The app scans 2D chessboards using your camera, then runs Stockfish analysis on the position.<p>Here&#x27;s how it works technically:<p>- We do segmentation first to crop the chessboard from the full image.<p>- Then we perform object detection to identify individual pieces<p>- Bounding box analysis for board alignment and perspective correction. This gives us a matrix 8 x 8 which represents the chessboard.<p>- We convert this position to FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation)<p>- Pass this FEN string to stockfish engine to get engine analysis.<p>The object detection model is reasonably good to the point where I thought of making the app public, but it isn’t 100% always and hence there is also an edit board option to handle it.<p>Right now I used a small dataset to train the object detection model. Labelled the pieces with bounding boxes using label studio and it’s a standard YOLO model. I am pretty confident on improving the model further with more data.<p>Try it:<p>iOS: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;stockfish-chess-analysis&#x2F;id6744956284\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;stockfish-chess-analysis&#x2F;id674...</a><p>App is behind a paywall as I need to run a server for inference. But there is a generous free tier for anyone who wants to give the app a go.<p>Would love feedback on the app and the underlying tech!",

So I was happily using another AI chat app but missing a few  features like a prompt library or workflows (because who doesn&#x27;t want their AI to do the work while they make coffee?). I did what any reasonable person does – wrote a lengthy email to <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t3.chat\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t3.chat</a> support with my wishlist.<p>Got back a super fast, thoughtful, and complete &quot;nope&quot; within hours. My hubris kicked in: &quot;How hard can it be? I&#x27;ve done this before!&quot;<p>Spoiler alert: Harder than I thought. But now I have LiteChat running at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;litechat.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;litechat.dev</a> and honestly? I think it turned out pretty damn good !<p>*What makes it different:*\n- *100% client-side* – your data never leaves your browser. Bring your own API keys and you&#x27;re set\n- *Multi-model everything* – OpenRouter for 300+ models, plus OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, local Ollama, whatever\n- *Workflow automation* – chain AI interactions, because that&#x27;s what started this whole thing\n- *Power user stuff* – conversation folders, prompt library, search, keyboard shortcuts, the works\n- *Code blocks that don&#x27;t suck* – edit them in-browser, run JS right in chat, export individual files or ZIP everything\n- *Git integration in the browser* – yes, really. Clone, commit, push from your chat app\n- *Virtual file system* – full CRUD file operations, all browser-based\n- *MCP server support* – hook into external tools and services<p>Started trying to build this &quot;vibecoding&quot; with <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t3.chat\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t3.chat</a> only (several arm joints thank me for eventually caving and using proper tools). Went full function-over-form so the UI has some... let&#x27;s call them &quot;discutable choices.&quot; Blame Gemini for that.<p>The repo is at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DimitriGilbert&#x2F;LiteChat&#x2F;tree&#x2F;beyond\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DimitriGilbert&#x2F;LiteChat&#x2F;tree&#x2F;beyond</a> (beyond branch has all the latest stuff) and you can try it immediately at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;litechat.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;litechat.dev</a> – no signup, no tracking, just bring your API keys.<p>If you&#x27;re tired of vendor lock-in and want a chat that actually does what you want, maybe give it a shot?<p>Would love feedback on what&#x27;s missing or what could be better. Flying solo on this so every star&#x2F;issue&#x2F;PR genuinely makes my day.",

Starting with around $5k in Azure credit, companies could re-apply for increments of $25k up to a total of $150k.<p>Based on the existence of this program, we did a round of friends-and-family fundraising and developed a business plan. We built a prototype in Azure. Microsoft reps were responsive and helpful. Things were looking good.<p>Then, unceremoniously and with about 48 hours of notice (much of which was the weekend), MS closed the program. Despite having submitted a request for the next funding increment before the program closed, they are declining to offer any more credit (although they are allowing us to use credit previously granted).<p>To be clear: it&#x27;s their money and their program. I&#x27;m not disputing that they are totally within their rights to make this change. But the timing and abrupt nature have left us, and I suspect more than a few others, in the lurch. As intended by their program, our prototype product is highly Azure-centric, and it will be challenging to find a path forward.<p>This is simply a word of caution: I would be wary of agreements with Microsoft.",

There are digital (Web Book, Audiobook) and physical (Paperback, Hardcover) formats.

The journey started with Twinery, the open-source tool for making interactive fiction, discovered right here on HN. The tool kindled memories of reading CYOA style books when I was a kid, and I thought the format would be awesome for writing a story my kids could follow along, incorporating play money to learn about transactions as they occurred in the story.<p>Twinery is a fantastic tool, and I used it to layout the story map. I really wanted to write the content of the story in Emacs and Org Mode however. Thankfully, Twinery provided the ability to write custom Story Formats that defined how a story was exported. I wrote a Story Format called Twiorg that would export the Twinery file to an Org file and then a Org export backend (ox-twee) to do the reverse. With these tools, I could go back and forth between Emacs and Twinery for authoring the story.<p>The project snowballed and I ended up with the book in digital and physical book formats. The Web Book is created using another Org export backend.<p>Ten Dollar Adventure: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tendollaradventure.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tendollaradventure.com</a>\nSample the Web Book (one complete storyline&#x2F;adventure): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tendollaradventure.com&#x2F;sample&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tendollaradventure.com&#x2F;sample&#x2F;</a><p>I developed another nifty feature that lets readers of the physical book access an online dashboard of achievements anonymously using secret &quot;magic words&quot; in lieu of requiring personal information. I couldn&#x27;t muster the effort to write a special org export backend for the physical books unfortunately and used a commercial editor to format these.<p>Twiorg: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;danishec&#x2F;twiorg\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;danishec&#x2F;twiorg</a><p>ox-twee: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;danishec&#x2F;ox-twee\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;danishec&#x2F;ox-twee</a><p>Previous HN post on writing the transaction logic using an LLM in Emacs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.tendollaradventure.com&#x2F;automating-story-logic-with-llms&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.tendollaradventure.com&#x2F;automating-story-logic-w...</a><p>Twinery 2: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twinery.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twinery.org&#x2F;</a>, and discussion on HN: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=32788965\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=32788965</a>",

    "text": "&quot;The Internet is dead. The Internet remains dead. And we have killed it.&quot;<p>Online advertising is broken, especially for small or local businesses. You either pay a fortune to giants like Google and Meta for questionable &quot;engagement&quot;, or you try to work with niche influencers, which has a whole different set of challenges, not the least of which is that it&#x27;s hard to scale.<p>I&#x27;ve been working on IncentivizeThis to create a more direct and (hopefully) authentic alternative. The idea is to connect businesses with content creators in specific communities (both local and online) that are uniquely suited to meet the businesses&#x27; advertising requirements.<p>Imagine a local coffee shop wanting more buzz. They partner with us to sponsor a bounty like: &quot;$10 for every Reddit post in r&#x2F;YourCity that mentions our new espresso blend and gets 10+ upvotes.&quot; A member of the community sees this, writes a genuine post they might have made anyway, and gets paid for it. This creates a hyper-local, word-of-mouth ad network where businesses get what they pay for, and creators are rewarded for their genuine influence. Obviously this could be used for less wholesome purposes, but being the bounty gatekeeper, I&#x27;d like to think that we can mitigate this.<p>Under the hood, the platform is designed to be robust and automated. Bounties are managed as long lived, stateful workflows using Temporal. An LLM performs the content assessment, and creators are paid out instantly in USDC on Solana. Finding the right opportunity is also easy thanks to a semantic search feature for active bounties.<p>The goal is to build a more effective advertising mechanism for businesses and a new monetization channel for creators. I&#x27;d love to get the HN community&#x27;s feedback on the idea and the execution.<p>You can check it out at the link above, or if you want to poke around the tech stack, the GitHub is [here](<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;brojonat&#x2F;affiliate-bounty-board\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;brojonat&#x2F;affiliate-bounty-board</a>).",

And here&#x27;s why:<p>* It downloads all of the MD5 hashes for all files at once, rather than one-at-a-time like &quot;p4 clean&quot;.\n* It computes the MD5 hashes of all local files in parallel, based on the number of CPU cores available.<p>By eliminating the round-trip-latency of requesting the MD5 hash for each file over a VPN connection, plus the increased performance from hashing all files in parallel, we got a 10x performance improvement.<p>The result: P4Sweep verifies a 400 GB workspace in less than 3 minutes on a 16-core workstation!<p>So you can be sure you have a 1:1 bit-for-bit copy of what&#x27;s on the Perforce server in the time it takes to get a cup of coffee!",

Turns out it&#x27;s not as simple as just changing the country in a dropdown, you have to start from scratch.<p>I had hundreds of users and using Stripe&#x27;s dashboard to add all of the products, prices, coupons and subscriptions manually would take ages. I contacted a couple of services that help with this kind of migration, but their quotes were way over my budget. My next option was to use Stripe&#x27;s API, which is very powerful but also very complicated. I&#x27;m a designer who can code, but I didn&#x27;t feel confident doing it alone, so I asked a friend, an experienced developer, to help.<p>It proved to be quite challenging, with many details and caveats we had to learn as we went. What we thought would take a couple of days took us a week.<p>After this experience, we teamed up and built <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripemove.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripemove.com</a>, a tool that guides you through this whole process, explaining and automating that hard week we went through. It handles the technical complexity while keeping your business running. Customers keep paying on your old account while everything transfers in parallel, then you flip the switch when ready.<p>It&#x27;s a very niche tool, built for founders who need to change their company location for personal or business reasons. For entrepreneurs buying companies established in other countries. For people in the same situation I was in a few months ago. Basically the tool I wished existed, and for a fair price. Designed to get you through this inconvenient process and back as soon as possible on growing your business.<p>Would love to hear from anyone who&#x27;s dealt with similar Stripe migrations.

I didn’t want to open a chat window every time I needed quick insight or to automate something.<p>*So I built a keystroke-triggered interface that works like this:*<p>- Press Option + Space (or any shortcut)\n- Select text, file, take a screenshot, or speak\n- Choose a model (O4, Sonnet 4, Flash 2.5, Ollama etc)\n- Get an answer — or run an action (like “send to Notion” or “create GitHub issue”)<p>It also supports [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;modelcontextprotocol.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;modelcontextprotocol.org&#x2F;</a>), so external tools (GitHub, Notion, Slack, etc.) can be plugged in and called directly.<p>I&#x27;m still a week away from the early release, but I&#x27;m sharing early to get feedback:<p>- Would this solve anything you’ve hit in your own workflow?\n- Does “keystroke, not chat window” resonate with you?\n- What would you expect from a tool like Launcher.so?<p>[Join the waitlist](<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;launcher.so&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;launcher.so&#x2F;</a>) if you’re curious<p>Or just share thoughts — I’d love your input.<p>Thanks,<p>*Deep*",

    "text": "PomeloAPI lets you swap between GPT-4, Claude 3, FLUX images, ElevenLabs speech and more with a single REST call. One schema, one bill, no vendor lock-in.<p>What it is:<p>• One REST endpoint that speaks to GPT-4, FLUX, ElevenLabs, Kling, Veo and more.<p>• A consistent request+response schema, so you can swap models without rewriting code.<p>• Usage-based billing that tracks each model’s native price. Pay only for what your app calls.<p>Why bother:<p>Every provider ships a different SDK, authentication method and pricing unit. If you want to experiment, run A&#x2F;B tests or add fallbacks, the glue code piles up fast. PomeloAPI hides that complexity. Call &#x2F;v1&#x2F;task, set model to whatever you need and ship.<p>Typical use cases:<p>• Content marketing: generate articles, social posts and ad copy in one pipeline.<p>• Product design: create mock-ups with FLUX images, then refine UI text with a chat model.<p>• Data analysis: summarize PDFs, extract entities and draft reports from the same job.<p>• Voice features: text-to-speech or speech-to-text with ElevenLabs using the very same auth token.<p>Example:<p>curl -X POST <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pomeloapi.com&#x2F;api&#x2F;v1&#x2F;task\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pomeloapi.com&#x2F;api&#x2F;v1&#x2F;task</a> \\\n  -H &quot;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&quot; \\\n  -H &quot;Content-Type: application&#x2F;json&quot; \\\n  -d &#x27;{&quot;model&quot;:&quot;gpt-4&quot;,&quot;messages&quot;:[{&quot;role&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Hello&quot;}]}&#x27;<p>Live now with a free tier.

I like to simply describe it as an AI co-founder that guides you through phases from idea to product.<p>What’s one cool thing about it?<p>You can do simple market research by searching through social media discussions like Reddit and X to see if problems are real before you build a solution for them.<p>This lets you see:<p>- If people experience the problem\n- How it impacts them\n- Existing solutions<p>It’s been resonating very well with our users and we just hit $6k MRR after 9 months since launching.<p>It’s just my brother and I working hard on this project, doing marketing, building, customer support, everything ourselves.<p>I just wanted to share it here in case there’s anyone who wants to build a product but is unsure if there’s demand for it. The problem research part of the app is free, so check it out if that’s you.<p>Let me know if you have any questions.",
